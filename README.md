# MHCLD Data Processing with Medallion Architecture

## Overview

This project processes the Mental Health Client-Level Data (MHCLD) using the Medallion Architecture to ensure clean, reliable, and analysis-ready datasets. The process involves three main stages: Bronze, Silver, and Gold tables, each serving a specific purpose in the data pipeline.

## Data Sources

- **MHCLD Data**: The raw dataset is sourced from various mental health service providers and includes client demographics, service usage, and diagnosis information.

## Medallion Architecture

### Bronze Layer

- **Purpose**: Store raw, unprocessed data as ingested from the source.
- **Transformations**: Minimal to no transformations to preserve the original data.
- **Example Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM mhcld_bronze LIMIT 100;
  ```

### Silver Layer

- **Purpose**: Clean and standardize data to prepare it for further transformations.
- **Transformations**:
  - Handling missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.
  - Standardizing data formats (e.g., date formats, categorical values).
  - Basic aggregations.
- **Example Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM mhcld_silver_partitioned LIMIT 100;
  ```

### Gold Layer

- **Purpose**: Provide fully transformed, business-ready datasets for analysis and reporting.
- **Transformations**:
  - Advanced calculations and aggregations.
  - Creating new metrics (e.g., age groups).
  - Partitioning data by important columns to enhance query performance.
- **Example Query**:
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM mhcld_gold_partitioned LIMIT 100;
  ```

## Transformations and Rationale

1. **Bronze to Silver Transformations**:
   - **Data Cleaning**: Remove duplicates and handle missing values to ensure data quality.
   - **Standardization**: Ensure consistent data formats to facilitate further processing.
   - **Rationale**: Clean and standardized data is crucial for accurate analysis and to prevent downstream errors.

2. **Silver to Gold Transformations**:
   - **Advanced Calculations**: Compute new metrics such as age groups to provide deeper insights.
   - **Aggregations**: Summarize data at different levels to support various analytical needs.
   - **Partitioning**: Partition data by key columns (e.g., `YEAR`, `AGE_GROUP`) to improve query performance and manageability.
   - **Rationale**: The gold layer provides business-ready datasets optimized for performance and analytical queries, ensuring quick access to insights.

## Monitoring and Validation

- **Schema Checks**: Validate the schema at each transformation stage to ensure consistency and correctness.
- **Logging and Alerts**: Implement structured logging and alerting mechanisms to track processing success and failures.
- **Data Quality Checks**: Automated checks for data quality, including schema validation, missing values, and consistency.

## Example Notebook

The following queries demonstrate how to retrieve data from each layer:

### Bronze Layer Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM mhcld_bronze LIMIT 100;
```

### Silver Layer Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM mhcld_silver_partitioned LIMIT 100;
```

### Gold Layer Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM mhcld_gold_partitioned LIMIT 100;
```
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of the Medallion Architecture to process MHCLD data. By structuring the data pipeline into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers, we ensure data quality, reliability, and performance, providing robust datasets for analysis and decision-making.
